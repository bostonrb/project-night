### Installing on Mac OS X

Please check your version of OSX before starting the setup process. You
can do this by clicking on the Apple in the upper-left and clicking
'About this Mac'. If at any time something goes wrong please call in an
instructor to help.

## OSX 10.5 and lower

Please call an instructor over to help. Unfortunately the odds are
very high with an operating system this old we might not be able to
help.

## OSX 10.6

Install XCode 3.2. You will need a paid Apple Devloper's account to
download this from the [Apple Developer website](https://developer.apple.com/). More likely there
will be someone with a thumb drive that has that version of Xcode. Skip
to General Installation.

## OSX 10.7+

Install the latest XCode. Please see if there is a thumb drive
available with the latest copy, if not you can open up the AppStore
and install yourself.

Once installation is complete open XCode and on the top menu bar
click on 'XCode/Preferences'. In the preferences pane click on
'Downloads' and then install the 'Command Line Tools'.

## General Installation

Now open Terminal, you can do this from your Applications folder or
you can click on Spotlight (the magnifying glass in the upper-right)
and type 'Terminal'.

Once in terminal you need to install Homebrew. You can do that by
running the following command:

```text
ruby <(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)
```

* Install [Git](http://git-scm.org):

```text
brew install git
```

Install [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv)

```text
brew install rbenv
```

At this point you need to add rb_env to your environment. Run the
following to do so:

```text
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Install [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)

```text
brew install ruby-build
```

Refresh your terminal

```text
exec $SHELL
```

Install Ruby 1.9.3 and set it to global

```text
rbenv install 1.9.3-p194
rbenv global 1.9.3-p194
rbenv shell 1.9.3-p194
```

Close an re-open your terminal and confirm Ruby is installed properly

```text
ruby -v
```

You should get something similar to 

```text
ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-darwin11.4.0]
```

If you do not see "ruby 1.9.3" please call in an instructor to help
diagnose the installation issue.

Install Rails and other supporting gems

```text
gem install bundler rails heroku
```

Congratulations, you now have the Ruby development environment up and
running. Now go forth and do something awesome with it!
