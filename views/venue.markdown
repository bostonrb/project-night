## subway

thoughtbot offices are less than 100 feet from the Park Street
Station on the Green and Red MBTA Lines. They are also one
block from the Downtown Crossing station of the Orange Line.


## parking

We recommend [Boston Common Garage](http://www.massconvention.com/bcg.html) (check their website for rates).
Although we consider the area around thoughtbot to be safe,
a group of volunteers will walk you back to the garage
at 10:00 pm.

## bicycles

You are welcome to bring your bike upstairs. Thanks again thoughtbot!
