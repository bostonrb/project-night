### Text Editors

A text editor allows you to edit files that make up your program.  If you are an
experienced programmer coming to Ruby from another language you probably have a
favorite editor.

If you are new to programming, we recommend you install the trial of
[SublimeText 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) as it's available on all
platforms and doesn't have much of a learning curve.

If you are an experienced [Vim](http://www.vim.org/),
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), or
[TextMate](http://macromates.com/) user, you probably know you can use them for
anything, including Ruby development.

### [SublimeText 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
[SublimeText 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) is a great text editor, available
on all platforms (Mac, Linux, and Windows). It has a free trial and at the time
of writing a single-developer license is $59.

### [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
[Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is similar to Notepad, but also has
some nice features built-in to support programming.  It allows multiple
documents to be opened at once through a tabbed windows interface. This is a
good option for getting up and running with Ruby on Windows without purchasing
an IDE.  Notepad++ is free and is only available for Windows.

### [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit)
[Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit) is a free text
editor developed by ActiveState, available on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
It provides syntax checking, smart auto-complete and calltips for Ruby,
JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Node.js, LESS, SCSS, Perl, PHP, Python, Tcl,
XML, HTML 5, CSS 3.

Looking for an IDE? Try out some of these [options](/editors/ides). If you don't
know what an IDE is, you probably don't want one.
