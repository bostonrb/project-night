## what
### BostonRB Project Night #3

Interested in building useful and amazing things with the Ruby
programming language or with Ruby on Rails?

Come to Boston Ruby Project Night.  Work on your own project or come
help someone with theirs.  Everyone is welcome, from beginner to expert.
Food and drinks will be provided courtesy of
[thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/).  Space is limited so please
[RSVP][rsvp]!

**We welcome newcomers!**  At Project Night, we will have a **Beginners'
Corner** staffed with volunteers ready to help novice Ruby or Ruby on
Rails programmers get off to a running start. To get the most out of
your time, you may want to try to get through [our installation
guide](/install) in advance of the meeting.  

Tired of hackfests where no one says hello to you and everyone is just
staring anti-socially into their computer screens? We want to make
Project Night different. We will encourage people to meet, connect,
talk, mentor, and learn from each other. 

Remember to bring your laptop and power cord.  Headphones are also
helpful if you plan to watch tutorials, especially for computer setup.
Please try to arrive roughly on time, as we will go around and have
everyone introduce themselves and say what they're working on or would
like to get help on at the beginning of the event.
